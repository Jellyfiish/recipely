# recipely mobile app

## Getting started
This is a mobile app built using React Native on [Expo](https://expo.io/). To get started, [download XDE](https://expo.io/tools) (Expo Development Environment) and follow the [installation guide](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v16.0.0/introduction/installation.html). You will also need to install the [Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/tools) on your mobile device.

After completing the installation guide:
* Clone the repo and run `npm install`
* Open the project in XDE. XDE will show you a URL like `exp://e3-hs6.jellyfiish.recipely-app.exp.direct:80`
* Open the app on your simulator or phone
  * On your phone, open the Expo app and type the URL into the address bar of the Expo app. Alternatively, you can send a link to your phone number or email address.
  * Click the `Device` button to open the app on your phone or in a simulator. If you want it to open it on your phone, make sure that your phone is connected to your machine. For Android phones, you will need to enable Developer Mode.
* Make a change in one of the `render()` functions of a file. You should see the app reload!
